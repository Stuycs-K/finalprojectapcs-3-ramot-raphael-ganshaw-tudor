This is to explain how I'll be doing the map stuff. Can be changed later, obviously.

0 - Empty Space
1 - Pellet
2 - Power Up
3 - Ghost House Wall
5 - Ghost Spawning Area
6 - Wall


So this can all be ints because of the fact that Pac-Man and the Ghosts don't really have to be on the map.
Like if we have a list containing all ghosts, everytime they move we can just have them check if Pac-Man is there, and if so, Pac-Man loses a life (or the ghosts
go back to their place if Pac-Man has a power up). Should make things way easier
